Q.Explain Machine Learning with your own example.
A.Machine Language is the language that is understood by computers and we use it to communicate with them. We enter the raw data in high-level language which will process the data to more refined form and its given as the input to the computer in machine language. The computer will execute and learn from the data according the instructions we have given before and use it as refference for future and gives output accordingly. This is known as Machine Learning.
One of the most common examples for this is the AI in games, eg.OpenAI which is first scripted by developers to respond according to the player's response and stores the log for future refference. This knoweldge keeps stacking up in the AI leading to it being able to make more efficient choices and control the outcomes of the game,making it more challenging each time.
